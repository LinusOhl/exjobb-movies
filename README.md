This was a project created during my time at school. My final project from school. Fetching and displaying data from the Movie Database (TMDB) with simple search/filtering and browsing + pagination. This project also included a user feature. As a user you can sign up and rate movies (1-5), save movies in a watchlist and mark movies as "watched". This is all stored on Firebase.
